Assignment Description:

I was assigned to a Project related web development, and the topic for the website is “Theatre”.

So, I have created a website which can be used by the local theatres to improve their reach to their customers.

I have made the frontend part of the website in 3 parts:

1.Home Page

\2. Seat Booking Page

\3. Going on and Upcoming Movies List Page

Home Page looks like this:



It contains a side logo mark on the top left corner, which can be the USP for any local theatre, the home page has two buttons in it 

1. Buy Ticket
1. Now Playing

Let’s press Buy Ticket button:

This is Seat booking page, where we can select movies as per our choice and we can also see their prices.

Here we can also allocate the seats of our choice.



Let’s press, Now Playing button. This Is how this page looks.
